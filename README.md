### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Raphael Osaze Eyerin

I am a software devloper from Nigeria, I code more frequently with Javascript/Typescript, I have also worked with Scala, Solidity and I'm looking at picking up Rust soon.

 - I build backend applications using Nodejs/Typescript and also Scala/Akka
 - I have been learning and working on Bitcoin projects for 8 months, and I am totally in love with Bitcoin because it means "Freedom and transparency" to me.
 - I have also worked on frontend projects using ReactJS and cross platform mobile applications using ReactNative
